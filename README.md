This objective of this data aquisiton was to get a dataset from the Federal Election Committee (FEC) for Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas.
I then downloaded a csv contatining this infomration and manipulated the dataset for analysis.
I was able to use statistical methods to compare the similarities and differences in voters in the KC area.
